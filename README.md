# Guide-System-for-Blinds-Using-Machine-learning

Blind Assistant is an android application for blind or visually impaired people.
Here we proposed a system that is actually a virtual assistant for a blind user. 
This applicationâ€™s GUI (Graphical User Interface) is very basic to make it easier to handle for blind people.
In our System blind can detect object recognize their relatives (face detection and recognition) and 
Also classify colors and finally we provide it with an alarm system or Guide System 
To alarm blind if there are any danger objects (which we already trained to recognize).
